QuasselDroid
============

Quassel is a distributed, decentralized IRC client, written using C++ and Qt.
QuasselDroid is a pure-java client for the Quassel core, allowing you to
connect to your Quassel core using your Android (TM) phone.

It requires a recent Android SDK , and the new build system.
- http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and
- http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system#TOC-Contributing

It uses the following extra projects (though all support libraries are included
for your convenience):
    - Otto: http://square.github.com/otto/
    - Android Support Library: http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html
    - Crittercism: https://www.crittercism.com/developers/docs-android
    - ActionBarSherlock: http://actionbarsherlock.com/

Building:
Building is done using gradle. Run "gradlew tasks" to see possible build tasks. Some useful tasks are
assemble and installDebug
NB! I have found some bugs with the build system where i have to run --info and or --stacktrace to not get errors
during build process.


We do support encryption, but no compression support for now (qCompress should,
in theory, be compatible with Deflater if you do some pre-parsing massaging on
it, but I haven't gotten it to work just yet).
